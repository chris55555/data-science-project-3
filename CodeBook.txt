## data-science-project-3

## This repo is for my project work for online collecting and cleaning data from coursera; It comes with the R code doc run_analysis.R and descriptive codebook.text. The raw data was directly downloaded from its web source and unzipped to "./UCI HAR Dataset" directory. In summary, this is how the run_analysis.R code works:  

## 1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  # Using read.table() to read three train files x_, y_ and subject_train.txt into R and combined to one complete dataset traindata
  # read three test files x_, y_, subject_test.txt and combined to one complete dataset testdata;  
  # read column names into R from file "./UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt" for data x_train and x_test  
  # Assign column names to traindata and testdata based on features.text and two extra column names "subject" and   "label"  
  # cleanup traindata and testdata by removing duplicated columns  
  # combine traindata and testdata as combinedata  
  
## 2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 # subset combinedata by only choosing those columns with name contains "mean" and "std" and columns "subject" and "label" and put in new dataset meanandsd 
 
## 3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 # read activity_labels.txt and replace "label" column values in meanandsd dataset to corresponding activity names (such as WALKING, LAYING etc.) according to this file.  
 
## 4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
 # replacing some column names of meanandsd dataset to more descriptive or longer version names, for example: Gyro	to Gyroscope; label  to activity etc.  

## 5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data  set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  # calculate average value of each variables for meanandsd and grouped by activity and subject and put result in subdata  
  # Write the data as subtidydata.txt under current working directory
  
In detail, here is the list of variables for this run_analysis.R code (description in bracket)
x_train  (readed from readings of traing data)
y_train (readed from activity of training data)
s_train (readed from subjects of training data)
x_test  (readed from readings of tes data)
y_test  (readed from activity of training data)
s_test  (readed from subjects of training data)
virables (column names for x_train and x_test)
traindata (combined training data combined from three datasets x_, y_ and s_train)
testdata (combined training data combined from three datasets x_, y_ and s_test)
combinedata (combined data.frame from traindata and testdata)
meanandsd (subset data.frame from combinedat which conatins only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement)
labels (data.frame readed from activity_labels.text as reference for converting "label" column value to descriptive activity names)
colnames (column names lists for data.frame meanandsd
subdata (resulted dataset from meanandsd calculated by with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.)
